Evaluation of different classification methods and performance metrics 
The repository contains Python code for evaluating (e.g. in terms of MSE, RMSE, R-Squared, and MAE) the following classification algorithms (e.g. available within scikit-learn machine learning library) on Adult dataset (in determining whether a person earns over $50K salary a year or not) taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

(1) kNN, 
(2) naive Bayes,
(3) SVM, 
(4) decision tree, 
(5) random forest, 
(6) AdaBoost, 
(7) gradient Boosting, 
(8) linear discriminant analysis, 
(9) multi-layer perceptron, 
(10) logistic regression.


The code can be executed through CLI by entering the Python script file name followed by designated training and test files(e.g. python Part1.py adult.data, adult.test).Alternatively, the the source code provided in the repository can be imported into a Python IDE(e.g.Eclipse)
